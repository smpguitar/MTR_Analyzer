# MTR_Analyzer
An Arduino Project for a portable SWR analyzer

This File is a work in process. Attempting to make a small field single port VNA for adjusting an antenna in the field for my Mountain Topper 4B V2.

The idea is that there are 2 modes: Automatic and Manual
If using Automatic it will auto step through a frequency range at a step rate set by the user and tell you the lowest SWR FREQ for the scan
In Manual Mode you can freely scan frequencies and it will provide the SWR real time
It will only work on the 4 bands of the MTR 4B.  20/30/40/80.
